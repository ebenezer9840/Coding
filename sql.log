6. What are joins and types of joins explain
ANS:
EQUI JOIN - Bring the Matching Record
Select t1.name, t2.course
FROM t1,t2

LEFT JOIN - Pulls all left side data eventhough it has no match in left side
Select t1.name, t2.course
FROM t1,t2
where t1.course=t2.course(+);
RIGHT JOIN - same like left join vice versa right
Select t1.name, t2.course
FROM t1,t2
where t1.course(+)=t2.course;
CROSS JOIN - it doesnt checks matches however will displays out no of row in table 1 * no of row in table 2
Ex: if table1 has 3 row and table 2 has 4 rows output will be 3*4 = 12 output 
Select t1.name, t2.course
FROM t1,t2
FULL OUTER JOIN - Displays all output of left and right side with matches and without matches
Select t1.name, t2.course
FROM t1 Full Outer Join t2
On t1.course=t2.course;

27. What is a View?

View is a logical table where the query been parased and store in database every time when we execute the query the SQL statement run and will bring the o/p from 1 or more table, View dont have any index not view data wont be stored in Database, View can perform a Insert if Master Table permits, 

30. What are SET operators?

SET operators are used with two or more queries and those operators are Union, Union All, Intersect and Minus.
Should have same column datatype in 2 tables

union --> bring matched/unmatched distinct record from both table in single column
unionall --> bring matched/unmatched duplicated record from both table in single column
intersect --> brings distinct matched record from both table in single columns
minus --> bring distinct value table t2 which are not in table 1

31. How can we delete duplicate rows in a table?

Duplicate rows in the table can be deleted by using ROWID.

32. What are the attributes of Cursor?

Attributes of Cursor are

%FOUND
Returns NULL if cursor is open and fetch has not been executed
Returns TRUE if the fetch of cursor is executed successfully.
Returns False if no rows are returned.


%NOT FOUND
Returns NULL if cursor is open and fetch has not been executed
Returns False if fetch has been executed
Returns True if no row was returned

%ISOPEN
Returns true if the cursor is open
Returns false if the cursor is closed

%ROWCOUNT
Returns the number of rows fetched. It has to be iterated through entire cursor to give exact real count.


36. What is hash cluster?

Hash Cluster is a technique used to store the table for faster retrieval. Apply hash value on the table to retrieve the rows from the table.

37. What are the various constraints used in Oracle?

Following are constraints used:

Case is a statement
Case can work with Logical operation like between < >
Case can be used in SQL/PLSQL Block
Case handles Null Differently

Decode is a function
Decode will cheeck for equality It will not perform any logical Operation
Since Decode is a Function can be used inside SQL statement

Collection	Record
The internal components always have the same data type, and are called elements
You can access each element of a collection variable by its unique index
Syntax: variable_name(index).
To create a collection variable : define a collection type and then create a variable of that type or use %TYPE.
You can create a collection of records.


The internal components can have different data types, and are called fields
You can access each field of a record variable by its name
Syntax: variable_name.field_name
To create a record variable: define a RECORD type and then create a variable of that type or use %ROWTYPE or %TYPE.
You can create a record that contains collections.

<=

4. What is DML and DCL, DDL

DML: Data Manipulation Language(Used for table Records)

INSERT - Insert Values to the table
UPDATE - Update Values in the Table
DELETE - Delete from table

DCL: Data control Language

GRANT : Which is used to grant access
REVOKE : takes back the granted access

DROP: Delete the table
 
5. How to Create Table with ('ID as primary Key' 'Name' 'Sales Org' 'salary')

ANS:
Create table king(ID number, Name varchar(60), Salary number, Primary key(ID));

6. Insert Data in Particaular Field 'Salary'
ANS:
INSERT INTO king Values(1,'Null',2000);
if table has primary key data cant be entered without Primary key

7. What is SQL
ANS:
Structured query language which is used to manage data held in a database
 
8. What is Numer Function
ANS: 
ABS : Shows absolute value ex: if data is -1111 by using abs we can pull value 111

   ex:  4 Dilip  -1111

select abs(salary) from king where id = 4;

Output: 1111

CEIL: Display the first decimal value
    ex:  3 Dilip  1111.2 

select ceil(salary) from king where id = 2;

Output: 1111

ROUND: Used to round off the value 

ex: value 778787.12322

select Round(Value) from king where id = 2;

Output: 

778787.13


select substr(first_name,instr(first_name,'t'),2) from employees where employee_id=100;
